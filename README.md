# Credit_Risk_Analysis

# #Purpose 
Apply machine Learning in credit card risk analysis.

## Results
In order to predict and analyze credit car risk, here are the 3 step to achive our goal.
1.Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk.
2.Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk.
3.Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk.

## Summary
We had sucessully apply both emsemble and resampling method to reach our goal, see below for the balanced accracy score for resampling and emsemble.

It turns out that the resampling methods balanced accuracy score is slightly high than ensemble method, which would be a more accurate method to use in analysing credit card risk.
